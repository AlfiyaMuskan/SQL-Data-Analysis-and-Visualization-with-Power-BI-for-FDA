The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize FDA (Food and Drug Administration) data using SQL and Power BI to gain insights into food safety, product recalls, and regulatory compliance.

Data Collection:
Data was collected from FDA's public datasets, which included information about food inspections, violations, recalls, and facility registrations. The data was extracted, transformed, and loaded into a SQL database for further analysis.

Data Analysis Techniques:
SQL queries were used to analyze the FDA data and extract relevant information. Various analytical techniques, such as aggregations, joins, and subqueries, were applied to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations within the data. The SQL results were then imported into Power BI for visualization.

Key Metrics and Insights:
Through the analysis, several key metrics and insights were derived. These included identifying high-risk food facilities, analyzing common violations, understanding the frequency and reasons for recalls, and assessing compliance with FDA regulations. The analysis also helped identify geographical trends and patterns in food safety.

Visualizations:
Power BI's robust visualization capabilities were utilized to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards. Charts, graphs, and maps were used to present the data in a comprehensive and easy-to-understand manner. Filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities were applied to allow users to explore the data and gain deeper insights.

Impact and Recommendations:
The analysis of FDA data using SQL and Power BI provided valuable insights for the FDA and food safety stakeholders. The FDA could identify areas of improvement in food safety regulations, target inspections more effectively, and take proactive measures to prevent foodborne illnesses. Food facilities and manufacturers could use the insights to enhance their compliance efforts and ensure the safety of their products.

Learnings and Reflections:
This project highlighted the power of SQL in querying and analyzing large datasets. It demonstrated the importance of data visualization in communicating insights and driving informed decision-making. Additionally, it emphasized the significance of data-driven approaches in ensuring food safety and regulatory compliance
